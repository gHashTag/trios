 * WHAT A DISPATCH ROW STILL CLAIMS (gHashTag/t27 specs/queen/claim.t27,
 * t27#8765; gHashTag/trios#1767).
 *
 * Every round asks it of every queen_dispatch row, and the board asks it of
 * every card: running, accepted, rejected, awaitingReview, failed or
 * cancelled. The card's claim_of decides, as generated wasm, and it imports
 * the review valve's own escalation_kind and next_step instead of restating
 * them. This file only reads the row into the card's codes and the card's
 * answer back into the word the round, the board and queend use.
 *
 * The rule was hand-written TypeScript in queen-tick.ts until this card. That
 * body is kept verbatim in tests/api/queen-claim-card.test.ts, where the card
 * is proven to answer it word for word over every input the round can pass.
