 * THE BEAT (specs/queen/netlink.t27 section 3, trios#1712): the entry of the
 * worker thread that renews a node's lease, with a connection of its own.
 *
 * WHY A THREAD. The lease was renewed by a timer on the event loop the actors
 * run on, so a turn that held the loop for a whole lease made a live node look
 * dead, and its peers started its children elsewhere (reproduced: a 25 s turn,
 * one false node-down). Erlang keeps its tick apart from the data for the same
 * reason. Here no turn and no slice can hold the beat up.
 *
 * WHAT IT SHARES. Three slots of one SharedArrayBuffer, read and written with
 * Atomics: the time the actors' loop last turned (the loop writes it), the
 * time the last confirmed renewal was SENT (this thread writes it), and a
 * refused flag (this thread sets it when the store refused a renewal). The
 * card decides from them: beat_renews here, must_fence on the loop.

 * compares it with come from one clock. It used to fire the interval on fake
