 * Starting the bee, not just picking it.

 * THE ORDER HERE IS THE DESIGN. Credentials are checked FIRST, before git is

 * clean up before they can even read it. Refusing costs nothing; refusing
 * halfway costs a directory and a branch.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, and it is not a coding gap: the container holds no push
 * credential, by design. A bee commits inside it, and the commit leaves as a
 * patch that the Mac replays and pushes - proven end to end on 2026-08-29. So
 * dispatch here produces work that is finished but not yet published, and the
 * publication step still belongs to a machine that has the credential.
