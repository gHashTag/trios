 *
 * The link between nodes on different machines (actors.t27 section 9,
 * t27#7900): the store is the wire. Made safe before its first caller by
 * specs/queen/netlink.t27 (trios#1712, lane 6).
 *
 * - INCARNATION. A start claims the node's row with the next incarnation
 *   (next_incarnation), in one transaction, and wins over any holder. Every
 *   pid the node hands out carries it, and every row it writes names it.
 * - LEASE. A worker thread with its own connection renews the row every
 *   NODE_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS (queen-actors-pg-beat.ts), so no turn can hold the
 *   lease up, and only while the actors' loop still turns (beat_renews).
 *   Every write is fenced: the store admits it only while the row holds this
 *   incarnation and the lease is up (write_admitted).
 * - FENCE. A node whose write was refused, or whose last confirmed renewal is
 *   SELF_FENCE_SECONDS old (must_fence), stops: its actors, its timers, its
 *   mail. It never takes the lease back; a new start takes a new incarnation.
 * - PEERS. Each heartbeat the loop reads every lease. The card says what
 *   changed (peer_change, peer_up): a lapsed lease or a newer incarnation is
 *   the old incarnation down, for good. The same read expires mail written
 *   for an incarnation that is over (mail_expired).
 * - MAIL. A send is one row plus pg_notify on the node's channel. The node
 *   LISTENs and also polls, the notification being a hint. It reads its rows
 *   in id order without taking them, handles each (mail_action), and only
 *   then acknowledges them. A lost answer costs a second read, and a row read
 *   again is acknowledged without being handled: no row lost, none twice.
 * - Nothing here decides anything. Every decision is the card's. The fences
 *   inside the SQL are the one exception the card cannot reach: a compare-and-
 *   set must run in the statement that writes, and t27c has no SQL backend.
 *   They mirror write_admitted, and a live test holds them to it.
