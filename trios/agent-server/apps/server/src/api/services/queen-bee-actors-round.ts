 * THE ROUND HANDS ITS ISSUES TO THE BEE ACTORS (MVP, gHashTag/trios#1712 item
 * 7). Only with TRIOS_QUEEN_DISPATCH=actors; unset, nothing here runs and the
 * round dispatches as before.
 *
 * The round still reads the issues and builds the board. At its dispatch step
 * it calls `handRoundToBeeActors` instead of looping over queend, and every
 * candidate gets a `ready`. From there the issue actors (queen-bee-actors.ts)
 * do the work:
 *   - admission asks queend about one issue against the round's board plus
 *     every bee started since;
 *   - the start is dispatchBee, as the round calls it;
 *   - a bee's end is the end of its dispatch row (finished_at), read when the
 *     bus says a task ended or a lease expired, and at every round;
 *   - a cancel is cancelTask (control.t27 section 3), which ends the row and
 *     bumps the fence, so the old bee writes nothing more.
 *
 * THE HOLDER IS THE ACTOR (keyed_guard.t27 section 1, trios#1729 item 7).
 * dispatchBee claims for the issue actor: this process's name and boot, then
 * its pid. A claim lands again only for that very holder, so a second
 * incarnation of an issue's actor, or a second dispatcher under one name, no
 * longer "renews" a claim whose bee still runs. The round renews and releases
 * the actors' leases with its own (renewRunningLeases, releaseTaskLease).
