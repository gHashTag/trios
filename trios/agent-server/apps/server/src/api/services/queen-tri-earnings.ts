/**
 * WHAT AN ACCEPTED SPEC HAS EARNED, WRITTEN DOWN ONCE.
 *
 * The owner, 2026-10-01: the people who write `.t27` specs should mine TRI for
 * the ones the Queen accepts, and later move it to a wallet. Nothing can be
 * minted from a number nobody wrote down, so this is the first half: an
 * append-only record of every accepted spec turn, the commit it was judged on,
 * and the lane that carried it. No token exists yet, so nothing here is
 * withdrawable, and the public answer says so in words.
 *
 * WHY A TABLE, WHEN THE LEADERBOARD DERIVES ITS SCORE ON EVERY READ.
 * The leaderboard counts turns; an earning is a claim somebody will later sign.
 * `queen_dispatch` is keyed by issue and overwritten on redispatch, and the
 * archive keeps a snapshot only when an attempt is overwritten - a CI take-back
 * edits the row in place. Derived on read, an acceptance that was later taken
 * back would simply stop existing, and the record would say it never happened.
 * Here it stays, with `revoked_at` beside it. Rows are inserted and revoked,
 * never deleted and never edited otherwise.
 *
 * ONE EARNING = ONE (repository, issue, judged commit). Its id is
 * sha256('t27-accept:v1|<repo>|<issue>|<commit>'), recomputable by anyone from
 * public data, which is what `work_id` in the mint protocol asks for: a hash of
 * the accepted work, not a bare counter (trinity-fpga,
 * specs/trinet/mint_on_acceptance.t27). The same commit accepted twice is one
 * earning; a new commit accepted after a send-back is a second one.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS A SPEC, HONESTLY: an accepted turn whose declared boundary
 * (`owned_paths`) names a `.t27` file - the same rule the leaderboard's `specs`
 * uses. That is the claim, not the diff; the spec paths are stored so the
 * claim can be checked against the commit.
 *
 * WHAT REVOKES ONE: a later verdict on the SAME commit that is a send-back or
 * an escalation - which is what a CI take-back is (queen-ci-verdict.ts). A
 * revocation is final for that earning: a fresh accept of the same commit does
 * not resurrect it, because an earning that can flip back and forth is not one
 * anybody can sign.
 *
 * THE AMOUNT is the owner's decision O2 (trinity-fpga
 * docs/docs/depin/decisions.md), taken 2026-10-01: 27 TRI per accepted spec in
 * epoch 1. It is published here, beside the record, so a signer can refuse an
 * attestation whose amount differs from the one anybody can read.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE: whether the commit was merged. Decision O4 says an earning
 * mints only once its judged commit landed; that is checked on GitHub by each
 * signer independently, not asserted by this record, so a Queen that lied about
 * a merge would convince nobody.
