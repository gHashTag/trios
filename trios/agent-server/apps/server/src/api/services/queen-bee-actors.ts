 * THE BEE DISPATCHER AS KEYED ACTORS (MVP, epic gHashTag/trios#1712 item 7,
 * gHashTag/t27#7851). It does the round's dispatch work, arranged as actors:
 *
 *   admission, one actor under its own supervisor: it answers one call per
 *     ready issue with a lane, wait, or refused (keyed_guard.t27
 *     admit_answer, and the policy's word through `deps.admit`, which is
 *     queend in production). When a lane frees, it wakes the waiting issues
 *     in the policy's order (wake_count), unless the lane's own issue
 *     restarts at once (keeps_lane_after_end): the wait ends on that event,
 *     not on the next round.
 *   one actor per issue (keyedActors, keyed.t27): the issue's state
 *     (bee_key_next, so a repeated ready starts no second bee), the claim
 *     (claim_step, with this incarnation's pid as the holder), the bee it
 *     started, and what happens when the bee ends (dispatch_exit.t27
 *     exit_reason, restart_decision, restart_wait_seconds).
 *   one bee actor per bee: one turn, which waits for the bee's work and is
 *     killed at the turn bound (actors.t27 turn_signal). The issue actor is
 *     linked to it and traps exits, so the bee actor's end is a message to it.
 *     A bee runs on a runner, so the turn only waits (ISO_LOOP) and a kill
 *     abandons the wait, not the bee. The issue actor then cancels the bee and
 *     keeps its issue and its lane until the bee's work has ended
 *     (holds_after_kill): a second bee never starts beside it.
 *
 * THE LANE BOARD (keyed_guard.t27 section 2, trios#1729 item 7). The
 * admission ran unsupervised, with the lanes in use in its own memory: one
 * crash ended every later admission, since each call met a dead pid. It is a
 * permanent child of a one_for_one supervisor now, and what it knows is on
 * the board, which outlives it as an ETS table with an heir outlives its
 * owner: the lane each issue holds, by its token, and the issues waiting.
 * Every write keeps the board true without the admission. A grant is written
 * in the turn that answers, and taken back in that turn when the answer
 * reaches nobody (grant_lands). A holder takes its own entry off before it
 * tells the admission. An issue's actor that ends holding a lane gives it
 * back unless its bee runs (lane_outlives_holder). An issue whose call finds
 * no admission waits on the board (after_admission). A restarted admission
 * wakes the waiting issues at once.
 *
 * Behind TRIOS_QUEEN_DISPATCH=actors, off by default. The round's loop stays
 * the default until the benchmark's numbers are accepted (t27#7851).
