 * The supervision round, running where there is no laptop.
 *
 * Everything this loop needs was moved into the container one piece at a time:
 * the checkout, the tools, the git credentials, the registry, and finally the
 * policy itself as a Linux binary. What stayed behind was the thing that wakes
 * up - so the whole apparatus was cloud-resident and still could not start a
 * round unless a Mac was awake to tell it to. This is that last piece.
 *
 * A round is: hold the lease, read the registry, ask GitHub what is open, let
 * `queend` decide, and write down what was decided. The deciding is deliberately
 * not here. It is in `queend`, compiled from the same eleven Swift files the Mac
 * app uses, because a second implementation of "which bee starts next" written
 * in TypeScript would be a second policy - agreeing at first, drifting later,
 * and impossible to tell apart from the first when they disagree.
 *
 * WHAT THIS LOOP DOES NOT DO: start the bee. Choosing and dispatching are
 * separate on purpose and this is the honest boundary of the migration today.
 * The container can cut a worktree and run a worker - that is proven - but the
 * dispatch path is still driven from the app. Recording the choice makes the
 * gap visible rather than hiding it behind a loop that appears to run.

 * The TTL is a LIVENESS window, not a work window. I had these confused.
 *
 * The first version reasoned "the TTL must outlive a round" and set it to three
 * times the tick interval - ninety minutes - renewing only when a round ran.
 * That is sound only if renewal and work are the same event, and it produced
 * exactly the failure it looks like it should: a deploy replaced the container,
 * the old holder died without releasing, and its lease went on holding the hive
 * for ninety minutes while the new one correctly stood down every round.
 *
 *   14:36:18 Queen tick starting          holder="f2375165-...:1"
 *   14:36:18 Queen lease held elsewhere    holder="9680f61f-...:1"
 *            self="f2375165-...:1" expiresAt="15:52:42"
 *
 * Nothing there is malfunctioning. The exclusion did its job; the lease was
 * simply describing a process that no longer existed.
 *
 * Separating the two fixes it. A heartbeat renews far more often than the tick
 * runs, so the TTL only has to outlive a couple of missed heartbeats - and a
 * holder that dies frees the hive in minutes rather than in whatever the work
 * interval happens to be. The round may then take as long as it likes.
