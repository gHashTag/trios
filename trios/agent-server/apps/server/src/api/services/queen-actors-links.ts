 *
 * The runtime in queen-actors.ts had monitors and nothing else: a failure
 * travelled only as a DOWN to whoever asked for one. The card already said
 * the rest; this file runs it.
 *   - links: bidirectional, one per pair (links_after_link). A death sends
 *     its reason to every linked process. A trapping one gets it as an EXIT
 *     message; another ignores `normal` and dies of anything else
 *     (on_exit_signal), with death_reason(signal). Linking to a dead pid
 *     answers noproc at once (attach_answer).
 *   - demonitor: drops the monitor; with flush, also a DOWN already queued
 *     for it (down_left_after_demonitor).
 *   - call: a request with a fresh alias, a monitor on the callee and an
 *     `after`. The first of reply, DOWN or timeout ends it (call_outcome).
 *     The alias then dies (live_alias), so a late reply is a dead letter, as
 *     OTP's process alias drops it. A call into its own chain is refused at
 *     once. The chain is its callers' pids, and keyed_guard.t27
 *     call_admit_chain refuses a call to any of them, at any slot. actors.t27
 *     chain_has saw slots 0..63 only, and this runtime never reuses a slot,
 *     so it passed every call once 63 processes had started (trios#1729
 *     item 7).
 *   - orderly stop: shutdown first, kill after the timeout (stop_signal),
 *     one child after another in reverse start order (stop_rank).
 *
 * WHY A SIDE FILE AND NOT queen-actors.ts. Other lanes change that file.
 * Its hooks here are four: `onExit`, `unwatch`, `mailbox` and `busy`.
 *
 * NOT HERE: links across nodes (a link to a remote pid is refused with
 * noproc), and a kill that stops an isolated turn's work. A link kill ends
 * the pid; only the turn-timeout kill in queen-actors.ts calls stopWork.
