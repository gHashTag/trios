 * THE CLAIM CARD (gHashTag/t27 specs/queen/claim.t27, t27#8765;

 * was handed to it.
 *
 * What is REAL here: the wasm the card generates (specs/queen/claim.wasm),
 * called through the same loader the round uses, and stateOfDispatch as the
 * round and the board call it. What is the REFERENCE: stateOfDispatch's
 * hand-written body as it stood on queen at 82bcc934, copied below verbatim
 * with its comments, and the constants it read, written as the values they
 * had there. The reference calls the review valve's HAND mirror
 * (queen-review-valve.ts), never the card, so the two sides share nothing but
 * the inputs.
 *
 * The grid is the round's whole input space at every boundary that matters:
 * each review_state word the column holds and words it does not, idle clocks
 * a minute and a millisecond either side of every floor (and unreadable,
 * negative and huge ones), and every counter either side of its ceiling.
 * A grid that agrees could still be blind, so each mutant of the reference
 * below (a floor moved by a minute, a ceiling or a default moved by one, a
 * word the boundary forgets) must disagree with the card somewhere in it.
