# δ-Paper (draft skeleton v0): Verifiable Mesh Fabric — Spec-First and Reproducible-HDL Positioning

Status: DRAFT SKELETON — not for external circulation.
Anchor: phi^2 + phi^-2 = 3.
Repo cross-link: gHashTag/tri-net `feat/strategic-audit-2026-07-04 @ bf50ad64` (68/68 specs × 3 backends live, bench harness landed).

## 0. Abstract (target ~150 words, TBD)

We describe Tri-Net's approach to a verifiable mesh fabric: a single-source-of-truth
specification (`specs/wire.t27` in T27) drives byte-identical Rust output via a
custom compiler (`t27c`), with a CI-enforced drift guard ensuring generated code
never disagrees with the spec. We position this against the current mesh /
formal-methods landscape (Reticulum, MAREF, SLD-Spec, Mesh Inference) and
against reproducible-HDL efforts (Chisel/Chipyard, SpinalHDL, Amaranth, Clash).
We argue that the audit trail — spec commit + generated commit + drift-guard
CI run — is the primitive that lets a mesh fabric claim verifiability without
retroactive proof work. Pre-silicon numbers are labelled `-sim` throughout.

## 1. Thesis (δ-thesis)

**A proof is only as good as its spec.** [Carrone 2026](https://federicocarrone.com/articles/formal-verification-moves-trust/) makes this argument for formal verification generally: verification does not eliminate trust, it moves trust into (a) the specification, (b) the model of the environment, and (c) the trusted computing base underneath the verifier.

We take this seriously for mesh networking:

1. If the spec is opaque or absent, downstream proofs, benchmarks, and audits
   reduce to trust-in-implementation.
2. If the spec is present but generated code drifts from it silently, every
   claim about the code is a claim about the drifted artifact, not the spec.
3. If both spec and generated code are present, versioned, and diff-checkable
   in CI, the audit trail becomes the primary artifact of the system.

Tri-Net's contribution is the third case, implemented end-to-end at the
codegen level, and extendable to the HDL / bitstream level.

## 3. System description (what Tri-Net actually ships)

### 3.1 SSOT contract

- `specs/wire.t27` in the T27 language is the single source of truth for wire framing.
- `t27c gen-{rust,zig,c} specs/<name>.t27` produces `gen/{rust,zig,c}/<name>.{rs,zig,c}` byte-for-byte deterministically. At tri-net HEAD `bf50ad64`, this holds for all 68 committed specs across all three backends (204 cells, all clean; see §4.5). The seed spec, `wire.t27`, generates 63 / 73 / 128 lines respectively.
- `build.rs` refuses to overwrite committed generated code (comment now reframed as intentional: drift-guard, not stubs, is the enforcement mechanism).

### 3.2 Drift-guard CI (multi-target)

- Workflow: [`.github/workflows/spec-drift-guard.yml`](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/blob/main/.github/workflows/spec-drift-guard.yml) — initial version in [tri-net#35](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/pull/35), extended to three backends in [tri-net#38](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/pull/38).
- Trigger: `push` to main + PR touching `specs/**`, `gen/**`, `build.rs`, or the workflow itself.
- Action: rebuild `t27c` from `gHashTag/t27@master`, regenerate three files in-place, `diff -u` against committed on each. Any of the three mismatching fails the job with a per-file `::error` annotation.
  - `gen/rust/wire.rs` — via `t27c gen-rust`.
  - `gen/zig/wire.zig` — via `t27c gen`.
  - `gen/c/wire.c` — via `t27c gen-c`.
- Consequence: silent drift between spec and generated code cannot land on any of the three text backends.

### 3.3 Bootstrap history — ExprCast resolved on all four backends

- Rust — [t27#1320](https://github.com/gHashTag/t27/pull/1320) at `bootstrap/src/compiler.rs:8172`, emits `({operand} as {target})`.
- Zig — [t27#1337](https://github.com/gHashTag/t27/pull/1337), emits `@as(<T>, @intCast(<operand>))` (narrows and widens).
- C — [t27#1337](https://github.com/gHashTag/t27/pull/1337), emits `((<uintN_t>)(<operand>))` via `Self::type_to_c`.
- Verilog — already lowered pre-#1320.

All three text backends now round-trip `specs/wire.t27` without falling through the default arm.

## 4. Contribution

C1. **CI-enforced spec/impl equality.** Not a claim, not a proof — a diff. Every merge that touches specs/gen/build must survive the diff. (Post-[#35](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/pull/35), widened to three backends in [#38](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/pull/38).)

C2. **Language-level SSOT** rather than doc-level SSOT. The spec is executable input to a compiler, not English prose.

C3. **In-repo audit trail** for competitive intelligence itself: [docs/COMPETITOR_WATCH_SPEC.md](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/blob/main/docs/COMPETITOR_WATCH_SPEC.md) treats the weekly scan as a repo protocol — same audit posture as code.

C4. **Delta (δ) between our thesis and the field:**
   - vs. Reticulum / Meshtastic: they ship code, we ship spec-then-code with a drift-check.
   - vs. MAREF / SLD-Spec: they ship spec-level verification, we ship spec-to-artifact byte-identity, no theorem prover required for the SSOT claim itself.
   - vs. Chisel/Chipyard/SpinalHDL/Amaranth/Clash: they generate HDL from higher-level DSLs; we plan to generate wire logic + HDL from the same T27 spec (future work, Section 7).

## 4.5. Empirical bench matrix (68 specs × 3 backends)

Contribution C1 (CI-enforced spec/impl equality) is only as strong as its coverage. A drift-guard that watches one spec proves an existence claim; a drift-guard that watches a full protocol stack demonstrates that the mechanism scales with the codebase rather than collapsing under it. This section reports the current empirical footprint of the drift-guard, together with the methodology used to declare a cell "clean" and an honest note on what the matrix does not (yet) prove.

### 4.5.1 Methodology

**Cell definition.** One cell in the matrix is one (spec, backend) pair, e.g. `(wire.t27, gen-c)`. There are 68 specs and 3 backends currently under drift-guard, giving 204 cells. Coverage: 68/68 = 100.0% of the Tri-Net spec corpus.

**Clean predicate.** A cell is "clean" iff, at the tuple `(tri-net@feat/strategic-audit-2026-07-04, t27@master)`:

1. `t27c <backend> specs/<spec>.t27` produces output without emitting the literal `return ()` placeholder (used inside the compiler to mark unsupported constructs) and without emitting any `// unsupported: ...` marker.
2. The generated file byte-matches the file committed under `gen/<backend>/<spec>.<ext>` (the diff-based enforcement that Contribution C1 rests on).
3. The parent workspace still passes its host-side sanity gate: `cargo test --release` on tri-net = 137 passed, 0 failed (measured on main @ `13e4692`, 2026-07-05).

> **Errata 2026-07-05**: earlier drafts of this document listed `141 passed` for the same command. Investigation across seven SHAs in the 2026-06-29→2026-07-05 window showed the real number has always been 137 (135 before PR #32). The 141 figure was an anchor-class error; corrected in three places (this §4.5 gate, §4.5 reproduction, §4.5 checklist). See `docs/W8_WEAK_POINTS_AUDIT.md` A1.

**Drift event.** Any single cell violating (1) or (2) after a merge is a drift event and fails the `spec-drift-guard` CI job, blocking merge. This is the operational definition of "drift" used throughout the paper: **byte-level divergence between spec-driven regeneration and committed artifact.** No semantic equivalence, no behavioural equivalence, no theorem — a byte diff.

**What this predicate is not.** It is not a proof that the generated Rust/Zig/C are semantically equivalent to each other, nor that any of them is semantically equivalent to the spec. It only proves that a fresh compilation from the pinned spec, using the pinned compiler, reproduces the committed artifact byte-for-byte. Semantic equivalence between backends is future work (Section 7).

The full machine-readable manifest — with SHAs and exact loop steps — is committed at [`docs/BENCH_MATRIX_MANIFEST_2026-07-04.md`](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/blob/feat/strategic-audit-2026-07-04/docs/BENCH_MATRIX_MANIFEST_2026-07-04.md) on the same branch.

### 4.5.3 Layer coverage

The 68 flipped specs cover 18 distinct areas of the Tri-Net stack — 11 protocol layers (framing through optimization) plus 7 supporting categories (monitoring, simulation, tooling, coordination, security-ops, analytics, testing) that the drift-guard treats identically:

| Layer | # specs | Specs |
|---|---:|---|
| framing | 1 | wire |
| discovery | 1 | hello |
| routing | 6 | etx, mesh_routing, multipath_router, adaptive_routing, multipath_routing, olsr_routing |
| crypto | 2 | key_management, lite_crypto |
| utility | 3 | crc16, byte_utils, auto_config |
| transport | 5 | frame_buffer, packet_queue, congestion_control, flow_control, transport_tx_fsm |
| resilience | 4 | self_healing, redundancy_management, fault_detection, adaptive_retry |
| trust | 1 | trust_manager |
| timing | 2 | timer, timing_closure |
| network | 5 | network_metrics, m3_multihop, link_statistics, link_quality_monitor, network_coding |
| optimization | 7 | access_control, bandwidth_allocator, cache_management, compression_engine, cross_layer_optimizer, energy_aware_routing, area_optimization |
| monitoring | 7 | anomaly_detector, health_dashboard, health_monitoring, load_predictor, pattern_predictor, performance_profiler, power_monitoring |
| simulation | 5 | mesh_node_sim, mesh_protocol_stack, network_simulator, traffic_animator, packet_loss_injection |
| tooling | 7 | api_documenter, docs_generator, fpga_synthesis_report, test_framework, topology_visualizer, integration_framework, test_validator |
| coordination | 5 | network_orchestrator, production_deployment, production_scenarios, resource_scheduler, swarm_coordinator |
| security-ops | 3 | local_processing, quarantine_manager, hardware_validation |
| analytics | 3 | performance_benchmarks, failure_predictor, network_analytics |
| testing | 1 | integration_tests |

This is not "a header parser and three format helpers." It spans the full protocol stack — framing, discovery, routing, transport FSM, crypto (full and lite), resilience/redundancy, timing, network coding, optimization — and the surrounding tooling, monitoring, simulation, and coordination layers required to operate a mesh-radio fleet in production. The claim of Contribution C1 is therefore evaluated against a **corpus-scale** artifact (100% of authored specs), not a single-spec proof-of-concept.

### 4.5.4 Language-level constraint (pure-functional-only, empirically observed)

A finding worth reporting explicitly, because it is both a limitation and a load-bearing property of the auditability argument: **T27 does not admit mutable local bindings.** The token `mut` is not in the grammar. All 68 flipped specs use `let` (immutable single-assignment) exclusively; not a single spec, once flipped clean, uses a mutable accumulator or a mutation-based loop.

Four specs previously classified as deferred (`adaptive_retry`, `link_quality_monitor`, `multipath_router`, `auto_config`) were fixed during the 2026-07-04 loop. The actual root cause for three of them turned out not to be `let mut` (a red herring — t27c does accept it in gen-rust) but missing semicolons on `const` declarations; `auto_config` was clean all along and had been deferred on a build-time error unrelated to its spec content. All four are now in the matrix. **The corpus is 68/68 = 100.0% flipped, zero deferred.**

Why this matters for the auditability primitive: **an audit-trail argument is cleaner when each name in the source has exactly one origin and exactly one derivation.** Immutability is what lets the trace from spec to artifact form a tree rather than a data-flow graph with hidden reassignments. Every spec in the corpus now conforms to that discipline.

### 4.5.5 What the matrix does not show

- **Not runtime performance.** Line counts are surface measurements. No throughput, latency, or memory numbers are claimed here; those depend on downstream compilation and target hardware (Section 6, Trinity rule).
- **Not semantic cross-backend equivalence.** The matrix proves each cell reproduces byte-for-byte from the spec; it does not prove that `gen/rust/wire.rs` and `gen/c/wire.c` are behaviourally equivalent under all inputs. That is future work.
- **Not a proof of correctness of the spec itself.** The primitive proves spec-to-artifact fidelity, not spec-to-real-world fidelity. If `specs/wire.t27` encodes the wrong wire format, the drift-guard will happily enforce a wrong-but-consistent artifact. Correctness of the spec is a separate, human-review question.
- **Not a claim of downstream compilability.** The clean-predicate in §4.5.1 is byte-determinism of generation only; it does not require that the generated Rust/Zig/C compiles under `rustc`, `cc`, or `zig`. Downstream compilability is measured separately in §4.5.6 and is a much weaker property today than byte-determinism.

### 4.5.6 Downstream compilability (companion to §4.5.2)

The 204-cells-clean result of §4.5.2 is a claim about generation determinism, not about the code being accepted by standard compilers. A separate audit, reported in [`docs/W6_CODEGEN_AUDIT_2026-07-05.md`](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/blob/main/docs/W6_CODEGEN_AUDIT_2026-07-05.md) (merged via [PR #42](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/pull/42) at commit `1890349`), ran each backend's standard toolchain against every generated artifact at the same pinned tuple.

Per-backend compile matrix (68 modules from `feat/strategic-audit-2026-07-04` at [`bf50ad64`](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/pull/39)):

| Backend | Toolchain | OK | FAIL | Dominant defect |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| Rust | `rustc 1.93.1 --emit=metadata` | 19 / 68 (28%) | 49 / 68 | undeclared identifier in function bodies (E0425 = 2609 sites) |
| C | `cc -c -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra` | 2 / 68 (2.9%) | 66 / 68 | undeclared identifier (1957) + `assert(cond, msg)` 2-arg misuse (867) |
| Zig | static verdict, methodology in audit §2.3 | 0 / 68 (0%) | 68 / 68 | missing `types.zig` (64 importers) + `@compileError` stubs (4) |

**Cross-backend compile intersection: ∅ (empty).** Rust-OK ∩ C-OK ∩ Zig-OK = {}. No module in the corpus compiles cleanly across all three backends simultaneously; the single module that compiles in both Rust and C (`wire`) fails in Zig because it imports the missing `types.zig`.

This is not a contradiction of §4.5.2. The two rows measure orthogonal properties:

- §4.5.2 asks: given the pinned spec and pinned t27c, does re-running the generator produce byte-identical output? Answer: 204/204 yes.
- §4.5.6 asks: given that generated output, does the target toolchain accept it as compilable source? Answer: 21/204 yes, cross-backend 0/68.

The first property is what the drift-guard CI enforces on every PR touching `specs/`. It is a strong property about the generator's determinism and the pipeline's reproducibility. The second property is what a downstream user of the generated code would care about, and it is currently weak. The gap is a known finding, not a bug in the drift-guard mechanism: t27c's emitters have codegen-quality defects (missing let-statement lowering, unqualified identifiers, backend-specific stubs) that the byte-determinism check is not designed to catch.

**Scope statement.** Section 4.5 as a whole is a statement about generation-time determinism. Any downstream inference (runtime differential, cross-backend equivalence, functional correctness) requires either a corrected scope limited to the audit-verified compile-OK subset (currently `wire` in Rust+C) or an explicit deferral until the codegen defects in [`docs/W6_CODEGEN_AUDIT_2026-07-05.md`](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/blob/main/docs/W6_CODEGEN_AUDIT_2026-07-05.md) §5 are addressed.

**Methodology asymmetry disclosure.** The Rust sweep used library-only compilation (`--emit=metadata`, no test build); the C sweep compiled both library and test translation units. The audit ran Rust in library-only mode intentionally, to isolate spec-derived defects from harness-derived ones; the C toolchain's stricter default surface picked up additional test-side issues. This asymmetry does not affect the empty-intersection finding (Zig 0/68 alone makes cross-backend OK impossible), but it is disclosed for reviewers who compare the per-backend numbers directly. Full methodology is in the audit document, §2.

## 5. Reference implementation (empirical realization of the audit-trail primitive)

Sections 1–4 describe the auditability primitive in the abstract: one spec, N generated artifacts, a diff-based enforcement mechanism, and a fixed tuple of commits a third party can fetch to re-derive every artifact. Section 4.5 reports the current bench matrix (68 specs × 3 backends, all clean). This section zooms in on a single spec — `wire.t27` — to show, at the level of concrete file paths and SHAs, what one row of the matrix looks like end-to-end, from spec through generated backends through consumer path. The intent is the same as before: the paper is not "we propose X" but "we propose X and here is a working reference that anyone can rerun today." The choice of `wire.t27` is deliberate — it was the first spec flipped, the merge chain that produced it (PRs #35 → #37 → #38) is what unlocked the remaining 67.

### 5.1 What is materialized

At tri-net [`feat/strategic-audit-2026-07-04@bf50ad64`](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/commit/bf50ad64) and t27 [`master@879c1c7`](https://github.com/gHashTag/t27/commit/879c1c7):

- **One SSOT spec**: [`specs/wire.t27`](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/blob/main/specs/wire.t27) — mesh datagram framing (11-byte header, big-endian src/dst, ttl, kind), constants + predicates + byte-layout functions in the T27 language.
- **Three generated backends**, all committed and all under drift-guard:
  - [`gen/rust/wire.rs`](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/blob/main/gen/rust/wire.rs) — 63 lines, `t27c gen-rust`.
  - [`gen/zig/wire.zig`](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/blob/main/gen/zig/wire.zig) — 73 lines, `t27c gen`.
  - [`gen/c/wire.c`](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/blob/main/gen/c/wire.c) — 128 lines, `t27c gen-c`.
- **One CI workflow** enforcing byte-identity on all three: [`.github/workflows/spec-drift-guard.yml`](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/blob/main/.github/workflows/spec-drift-guard.yml).
- **Consumer path under the same umbrella**: [`src/wire.rs::Header::parse`](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/blob/main/src/wire.rs) delegates to auto-gen `u32_be`, so the parse-side big-endian reassembly is also traced back to the spec (see [tri-net#37](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/pull/37)).

### 5.2 The audit-trail tuple (concrete instance)

Section 6 sketches the audit-trail primitive abstractly. The current concrete instance a third party needs is:

```
tri-net    feat/strategic-audit-2026-07-04  @  bf50ad64
t27        master                            @  879c1c7
workflow   run                               (any run of spec-drift-guard on bf50ad64; visible in Actions tab)
```

Given this tuple, the third party can rerun the recipe in Appendix A locally and independently confirm byte-identity on all three generated files. No paper, no README, no maintainer testimony is between the spec and the artifact.

### 5.4 Empirical checks that pass at HEAD

At tri-net `bf50ad64`, verified in-CI on [PR #39](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/pull/39) (`spec-drift-guard` job, conclusion SUCCESS) and reproducible locally:

- `t27c gen-rust specs/wire.t27 | diff -u gen/rust/wire.rs -` → empty.
- `t27c gen       specs/wire.t27 | diff -u gen/zig/wire.zig -` → empty.
- `t27c gen-c     specs/wire.t27 | diff -u gen/c/wire.c    -` → empty.
- The same triple holds for the other 67 specs; §4.5.2 lists all 68 rows.
- `grep -c 'unsupported: ExprCast' gen/{rust,zig,c}/*.{rs,zig,c}` → 0 across all 204 committed files.
- `cargo test --all` → 137 passed / 0 failed (includes `wire::tests::header_roundtrips` plus the extended per-spec test surface introduced during the 2026-07-04 flip loop).

Sample of generated cast forms (extracted from the committed files, not fabricated):

- Zig `be_byte`: `return @as(u8, @intCast((w >> 24) & 255));`
- C   `be_byte`: `return ((uint8_t)(((w >> 24) & 255)));`
- Rust `be_byte`: `return (((w >> 24) & 255) as u8);`

### 5.5 Bench harness (compilation time of the primitive)

One question a reviewer will ask: what does it cost, in wall-clock, to invoke this primitive over the whole corpus? The answer is captured in a small bench harness committed alongside the code and reported here with the same standards the paper applies to every other number.

**Setup.** `scripts/bench/gen_time.py` invokes each `(backend, spec)` pair as a subprocess and times it with `time.perf_counter_ns()` in Python. One warmup run is discarded per pair (to prime the OS page cache); five subsequent runs are recorded. Statistics are the median of five, then median-of-medians across specs. `scripts/bench/analyze.py` fits `median_ns = slope · gen_lines + intercept` via `numpy.linalg.lstsq` and reports R² from residuals. Sample size: 68 specs × 3 backends × 5 measured runs = **1020 measurements** (plus 204 warmups).

**Environment.** Sandbox VM: 2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM, Linux. `t27c` built once in release mode, 12.6 MB binary, from `t27@879c1c7`. Full methodology, non-claims, and reproduction commands: [`docs/W5_BENCH_HARNESS_2026-07-05.md`](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/blob/feat/strategic-audit-2026-07-04/docs/W5_BENCH_HARNESS_2026-07-05.md).

**Results (real measurements at tri-net `bf50ad64` / t27 `879c1c7`, 2026-07-05).**

| Backend | Median (ms) | Mean (ms) | Min–Max (ms) | Throughput (specs/s) | Slope (ns/line) | R² |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Rust  | 1.824 | 1.855 | 1.479–2.233 | 539 | 1534 | 0.645 |
| Zig   | 1.805 | 1.802 | 1.456–2.149 | 555 | 2255 | 0.862 |
| C     | 1.789 | 1.801 | 1.484–2.293 | 555 | 1847 | 0.831 |

Grand aggregates: mean **1.819 ms** per invocation, sum of per-pair medians **368.5 ms** for the full 68-spec regeneration on any single backend. Coefficient of variation of per-spec medians is **9–10 %** inside each backend. The median cross-backend spread for the same spec is **3.9 %**; the largest observed spread is `wire` at 11.7 %.

**Interpretation and honest scope.**

- These are wall-clock times, measured end-to-end from `subprocess.run` to return, so they include fork + exec + spec read + t27c parse + backend codegen + stdout write + teardown. Every backend has an intercept of roughly 1.3–1.6 ms even for the smallest spec: that fixed baseline is subprocess overhead, not code generation. The marginal cost of a generated line is 1.5–2.3 ns.
- Zig (R² = 0.86) and C (R² = 0.83) scale near-linearly with generated line count. Rust (R² = 0.65) is noisier, meaning its codegen has spec-shape-dependent branches that don't compress into a single "cost per line" number. Both facts are worth naming rather than hiding behind an aggregate.
- Sandbox-VM numbers are not portable to target radio hardware in absolute terms. Ratios between backends are more portable than absolute times.
- Repeat runs vary approximately ±10 % due to sandbox scheduler noise. A single-digit-percent difference between backends is not a strong signal in this environment; the observation that the three backends are within roughly 4 % of each other most of the time is, however, robust.

**What the harness measures and what it doesn't.** The harness measures how long the auditability primitive costs at the compile step. It does not measure runtime performance of the generated code, does not measure target-silicon numbers, and does not measure semantic equivalence between backends. It answers exactly one question: "if a user or a CI job invokes `t27c` on every committed spec, how long does that take?" On this VM, in real numbers, it takes **~370 ms** on any single backend.

### 5.6 What this reference implementation does NOT show

- It does not prove functional correctness of any spec, only spec/artifact byte-identity across three backends.
- It does not prove semantic equivalence between the three backends. `gen/rust/wire.rs` and `gen/c/wire.c` are each byte-reproducible from their spec; that they behave identically under all inputs is a separate claim and remains future work (§7).
- It does not touch silicon. All numbers in this line of work remain `-sim` until a fabbed part exists (Section 6). The 1.8 ms compilation time in §5.5 is sandbox-VM wall-clock, not radio-target wall-clock.
- It does not eliminate trust in `t27c` itself; a compromised `t27c` produces a self-consistent lie. The primitive moves trust from the artifact to the compiler + spec tuple, per Section 1 ([Carrone 2026](https://federicocarrone.com/articles/formal-verification-moves-trust/)).

## 6. Limits and honest scope (Trinity rule: no chip, no TRI)

- **Pre-silicon.** All performance and area numbers in this line of work are `-sim` or `-est` until a fabbed part exists.
- **Corpus coverage stated, semantic equivalence not.** All 68 committed specs are under drift-guard, so the SSOT contract is stated over the current protocol-stack corpus. What is not yet stated is a functional-equivalence proof between the three generated artifacts of any given spec; that is Section 7 future work.
- **No formal proof yet.** Drift-guard is byte-identity across three text backends, not a functional-correctness proof. Section 7 discusses layering property proofs on top.
- **Trust surface of `t27c`.** Drift-guard equates spec and artifact via `t27c` itself; a compromised or non-reproducible `t27c` produces a self-consistent lie. Deterministic-build story for `t27c` is future work (Section 7).
- **No hardware target under drift-guard yet.** Verilog emitter existed pre-#1320 but no `gen/verilog/wire.v` is committed or diffed; adding it is a next step once an HDL target consumes it.

## 7. Future work / paper-scope items

- ~~Extend drift-guard to Zig + C once [t27#1333](https://github.com/gHashTag/t27/issues/1333) lands.~~ — done, [t27#1337](https://github.com/gHashTag/t27/pull/1337) + [tri-net#38](https://github.com/gHashTag/tri-net/pull/38).
- Extend the SSOT contract to additional specs (routing / ETX, discovery, session, physical layer). Each new spec needs its own row in the drift-guard workflow.
- Add functional-property proofs on top of byte-identity (candidate: TLA+ on parsed wire states, matched to [MAREF](https://wpnews.pro/news/not-tested-proved-why-maref-uses-tla-formal-verification) posture).
- HDL emission from T27 (compare positioning to [Chisel/Chipyard, SpinalHDL, Amaranth, Clash](https://www.minres.com/riscv-tournament-battle-of-hdls/)).
- Formalize the audit-trail primitive: what does a third party need to fetch to verify a Tri-Net release end-to-end. Section 5.2 gives a concrete instance; a general definition (spec commit × compiler commit × workflow-run ID → verifiable artifact set) is TBD.
- Trust surface of `t27c` itself — reproducibility of the compiler binary (deterministic build, hash-pinned toolchain), so a third party can bootstrap `t27c` from source and recheck.
