// STANDING INVARIANTS - the guardrails, machine-checked, every cycle.
//
// A self-improving runtime's safety claims are usually self-graded: a policy
// struct, a comment, a promise in a README. `HivePolicy` is exactly such a
// file. These invariants are the falsifiable version: pre-declared, checked
// before every dispatch, and able to halt the loop rather than merely describe
// what it ought to do.
//
// They are deliberately about the loop's *own* configuration and bookkeeping,
// not about the code it edits. An invariant that needs a model to evaluate it
// is not an invariant.
