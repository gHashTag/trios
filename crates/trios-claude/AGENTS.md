# AGENTS.md — trios-claude

## Identity

- Crate: trios-claude
- Tier: 2 (SILVER)
- Status: Scaffolded (logic migration: TODO)
- Repo: gHashTag/trios

## What this crate does

Existing logic in `src/`. The `rings/` directory contains scaffold packages
for the future ring-isolation migration per issue #238.

## Ring map

| Ring | Package | Role | Sealed |
|------|---------|------|--------|
| CL-00 | trios-claude-cl-00 | client | No |
| CL-01 | trios-claude-cl-01 | tools | No |
| CL-02 | trios-claude-cl-02 | dispatch | No |
| BR-OUTPUT | trios-claude-br-output | assembly | No |

## Rules (ABSOLUTE)

- Read repo `LAWS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` before any action
- L-ARCH-001: After migration, logic lives in `rings/` — `src/lib.rs` becomes RE-EXPORT
- R1–R5: Ring Isolation
- R9: No cross-ring imports except via Cargo.toml
- L6: Pure Rust only
- L7: Experience line per merge

## Migration plan

1. Stub rings exist with passing tests (this PR)
2. Future PR: extract types/logic from `src/` into appropriate rings
3. `src/lib.rs` becomes thin re-export facade

## You MAY NOT (until migration complete)

- ❌ Add new logic to `rings/<ring>/src/lib.rs` beyond stub types
- ❌ Cross-import rings without Cargo.toml declaration
